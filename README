There isn't really anything to say here, except that this is a collection of my work in scheme as I work through a couple of books to try and learn the language more thoroughly.  I am using recent versions of Guile scheme as my development environment, specifically 2.0.5. I previously used Ypsilon scheme as my development environment and so I am still in the process of converting my code to run in guile, so there may be some files that do not run properly in guile yet.  I will continue to fix up these files as I go.
